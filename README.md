# Web Development Project 4 - *Random Dog Viewer*

Submitted by: **Shaun Colegado**

This web app: **shows a picture of a random dog**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
    - The Dog API itself is faulty, I added the "&has_breed=true" to the request, yet it would frequently return dogs without the adequate data.
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [X] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

I had some challenges creating the series of list components in a way that allowed them to alter array values and actually be deleted.
